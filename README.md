Capturing piano performance with depth vision

This program uses OpenCV 3.2.0 and the depth stream from a Kinect V2 camera to track keypress events on a piano keyboard. Crucially, the information captured includes the velocity of each keypress.

I will shortly be doing a write-up for VMIDI on my website, and updating this readme accordingly.
